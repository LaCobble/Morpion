This project is a Java program that implements the game of Tic-Tac-Toe using the Minimax algorithm to calculate the best possible move at each turn.

## Game Overview

Tic-Tac-Toe is a popular game played on a 3x3 grid. Two players take turns, one playing with the symbol "X" and the other with the symbol "O". The goal of the game is to align three identical symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

## Features

- The game is implemented using Java.
- The Minimax algorithm is used to calculate the best possible move for the computer player at each turn.
- The user interface is console-based.
- Players can enter the coordinates of a cell to place their move.
- The game checks if either player has won or if the game is a tie.
- The game displays the board at each turn and informs the players of the game result.
